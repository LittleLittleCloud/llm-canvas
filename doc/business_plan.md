# LLM Canvas Business Plan

## Project Overview

LLM Canvas is an innovative platform for visualizing Large Language Model conversations, supporting conversation branches, retry mechanisms, and tool call visualization. The project adopts a Python + FastAPI backend and React + TypeScript frontend architecture, offering both local and cloud deployment options.

## Product Feature Comparison

### 1. Local Server - Free & Open Source

#### Core Features

- **Free & Open Source**: Completely free local deployment solution
- **Local Deployment**: Runs entirely in the user's local environment
- **Real-time Visualization**: Support for real-time conversation updates through SSE streaming
- **Conversation Branch Management**: Visualize conversation tree structures with branching and backtracking
- **Tool Call Display**: Show LLM tool usage processes and results
- **Multi-format Support**: Support for text, code, images, and other content formats
- **API Integration**: Simple Python SDK, easy to integrate into existing projects

#### Key Limitation

- **No Data Persistence**: Local deployment lacks long-term data persistence support
- Session-based storage only
- Data is lost when server restarts
- No backup or recovery mechanisms

#### Target Users

- Individual developers and researchers
- Open source community contributors
- Privacy-conscious users
- Development and testing environments

### 2. Cloud Server - Data Persistence Focus

#### Core Differentiator

- **Data Persistence**: Primary advantage over local deployment is permanent data storage
- **Reliable Storage**: Cloud-based data persistence with backup and recovery
- **Cross-device Access**: Access your canvases from anywhere
- **Data Security**: Encrypted storage with redundancy

#### Additional Cloud Features

- **Multi-tenant Support**: Support for multiple users with data isolation
- **High Availability**: 99.9% service availability guarantee
- **Auto Scaling**: Automatic resource adjustment based on load
- **Team Collaboration**: Support for team shared canvases and collaborative editing
- **API Management**: Unified API gateway with rate limiting and monitoring

## Key Value Proposition

### Local vs Cloud: The Data Persistence Divide

**Local Server**:

- ✅ Free and open source
- ✅ Complete privacy control
- ❌ No data persistence
- ❌ Session-only storage

**Cloud Server**:

- ✅ Permanent data storage
- ✅ Cross-device accessibility
- ✅ Backup and recovery
- ❌ Subscription required

The fundamental difference between local and cloud deployment is **data persistence**. While the local server offers all visualization capabilities for free, users must upgrade to cloud plans for permanent data storage and cross-session accessibility.

## Business Model

### Revenue Strategy

- **Freemium Model**: Free local version drives adoption
- **Data Persistence Premium**: Cloud subscription for data storage
- **Tiered Pricing**: Multiple cloud plans for different user needs

### Target Market

- **Primary**: AI developers and researchers
- **Secondary**: Teams building LLM applications
- **Enterprise**: Organizations requiring collaboration features

## Competitive Advantage

1. **Open Source Foundation**: Free local version builds community trust
2. **Clear Value Proposition**: Data persistence as the primary differentiator
3. **Developer-Friendly**: Simple integration and deployment
4. **Flexible Deployment**: Choose between free local or feature-rich cloud

## Summary

LLM Canvas offers a unique dual approach: a free, open-source local server for development and testing, and cloud-based solutions that add crucial data persistence capabilities. This strategy allows users to start free and upgrade when they need permanent data storage and collaboration features.
