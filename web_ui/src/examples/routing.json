I'll review your account history immediately\n2. If there was no authorized upgrade, I'll process a $20 refund within 1-2 business days\n3. I'll ensure your plan is set back to the $29.99 basic tier\n4. You'll receive an email confirmation once these changes are complete (within 24 hours)\n\nTo prevent future unexpected charges, you can:\n- Monitor your usage through your account dashboard\n- Set up email alerts for plan changes\n- Enable auto-notifications before any automatic upgrades\n\nWould you like me to proceed with reviewing your account? Please provide your account number or the email address associated with your subscription.\n\nBest regards,\nBilling Support Team",
